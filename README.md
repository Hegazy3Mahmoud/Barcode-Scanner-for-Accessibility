# Barcode-Scanner-for-Accessibility
This project is a graduation project designed to help blind people navigate markets and other shopping environments by providing information about products through QR codes and barcodes. The tool scans QR codes and barcodes to read out product information, making it easier for visually impaired individuals to make informed decisions while shopping.
